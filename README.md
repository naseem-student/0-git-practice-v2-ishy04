# Why I Find it Interesting
I enjoyed the article because it highlights the creativity required in software development. As someone who has always been interested in the arts, I appreciate how software engineering allows me to bring that same creative mindset into a more technical field. Itâ€™s exciting to think about how I can adapt my artistic way of thinking to solve complex problems and design innovative solutions in the tech world. This blend of creativity and logic makes software development appealing to me.

I really like how the article mentions using creativity to change the scope of what software development currently is. By being able to think creatively we would ensure new and unique ways solutions to erros and issues we face everyday. Maybe it doesn't have to be an error we could just develop new ways to streamline certain processes so that we could reduce the time for certain program runs or maybe we found that something was more inefficient. The point being that by allowing yourself to have a creative and different mindset you are enabling yourslef to a wold of different possiblities, that would otherwise be locked away because of traditional and enforced thought processes. - "Naseem Uddin"
